- I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Shandong University.
- I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. Bin Xiao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csbxiao/). Prior to that, I obtained my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Software Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, where my M.Sc. supervisor was Prof. Hua Dai.
- My research interests focus on AI security, including the robustness of 2D and 3D deep learning models, generative model security, and MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) security.
